      <title>Customer Churn Reduction</title>
      <link>https://vihall95.github.io/portfolio/post/project-two/</link>

      <guid>https://vihall95.github.io/portfolio/post/project-two/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this project is to utilize different machine learning techniques to create a tool that a company can use to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. By providing these predictions any number of business stakeholders like, a marketing or merchant team, can produce strategies to intervene and try to prevent churn. Multiple classification models were tested before the final results was chosen.
Models Evaluated Logistic Regression - Baseline linear classifier for binary data Random Forest - Ensemble Bagging Classifier (Bootstrap Aggregation).</description>

      <description>This project uses unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to improve the results of targeted advertising. the data came from a Kaggle challenge. After initial data cleansing and EDA, KMean Clustering is used to identify latent groupings and then those results were used as an additional feature for Logistic Regression

      <title>Data Storage Management with Python and Parquet</title>
      <link>https://vihall95.github.io/portfolio/post/project-four/</link>

      <guid>https://vihall95.github.io/portfolio/post/project-four/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate different creation and retrieval strategies for accessing airline data stored in Parquet file formats. This dataset contains flight route information from OpenFlights. The original data in stored as JSONL in zip file. The JSON data is parsed, converted to Parquet and saved folders created by key. Then different retrieval techniques are employed to access the Parquet files is a digestible form.</description>

      <guid>https://vihall95.github.io/portfolio/post/project-eight/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this project was to use a series of features about mobile phones to help determine what price range a phone should be in for a fledgling business. The data, which came from Kaggle.com, was cleaned and prepped, then used to test two main classifier modeling techniques wherein numerous parameters were examined. Two modeling methods, Random Forest and XGBoost were tested with multiple parameter values until the best accuracy was achieved.</description>
